# rock-paper-scissors
This project was created as part of The Odin Project course. The first part was learning to create an algorithm to play a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. This part was straightforward due to what I learned in the course so far as well as my prior experience having completed Harvard's CS50 course.

The second part was integrating the game with an interactive UI. I lacked experience in this domain, so this was a good learning opportunity for me. I challenged myself to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive UI, and I was satisfied with the result.
